# Beam me up Scotty!
Scotty is a platform that allows ordinary motorcyclists to take passengers (and food, packages and anything carryable) wherever they want to go at an affordable price. In a way, Scotty function as the middleman, bringing together citizens and motorcyclists who want to get from one place to another as quickly as possible on a motorcycle. With the Scotty app, you can go from one place to another for almost one-third the average taxi fare; plus, you get to avoid the notorious traffic jams of Istanbul. If you are trying to save time, you can easily get into this app and change your traveling habits with a few keystrokes.

Scotty was setup by a group of Scottyzen in a sweet spring evening in order to get back the time stolen by traffic to our social lives. The Scotty dream, which first started in Ümraniye at 1 + 1 apartment building, has now become a chain of thousands of drivers and around a hundred employees.

# Scotty Values

We think that "time" is the greatest treasure of human mankind and it is the only thing that can not be reloaded. So as Scottyzen, from eating lunch to traveling we dream of making everyone save "time", and we never give up our values as Scottyzen while realizing this dream.

We are user focused. Scottyzens are Scotty users at the same time. That's why we know how people feel when he or she is waiting for a meal or get stuck in the traffic. We work hard with Scotty to make the lives of individuals better. Empathy is our business's leading actor!

We get the things done! As the Scottyzen, we are like Marvel characters! We have many special powers! Our communication is strong, we are sincere, we own the business, we take the initiative, we push our limits to make quick decisions and get the things done fast!

We are the change itself. Being Scottyzen means being part of a team that becomes better every single day. We constantly improve ourselves, learn new things, and teach our surroundings. 

We believe that the newcomers should become better than us. We achieve that by mentoring and delivering positive and negative feedback to anyone who needs to contribute to their self-development.

We are modest. At the end of each day, we feel the pleasure and pride of saving thousands of people from traffic and beaming their food up to people in minutes. 

We start each day as our first day and pay attention to being accessible to the users even at peak hours. We do not see anyone in the same sector as a competitor, we support everybody who saves time in big cities.
